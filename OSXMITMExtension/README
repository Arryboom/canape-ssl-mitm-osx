CANAPE 1.3 OSX/iOS SSL MITM Vulnerability Extension

Copyright (C) 2014 James Forshaw

This CANAPE extension contains a layer which implements SSL in such a way to exploit the recent SSL vulnerability. It can be used to test 
applications on vulnerable versions of the OS if they are using certificate pinning (and the Apple SSL libraries) without having to modify
binaries or Jailbreak the device.  

This extension comes with no WARRANTY. I take no responsibility for potential misuse of this extension. It's for research and testing purposes only.

Installation:

CANAPE v1.3 can be downloaded from http://canape.contextis.com. 

Open up CANAPE, select the menu option Extensions->Extension Manager. On the resulting dialog click the Open User Directory button. This should 
create an explorer window. Copy all files to that directory and restart CANAPE.

Usage:

For a simple example just open the provided http_proxy_osx.canape project. This will MITM the SSL through a HTTP proxyand has been configured 
correctly. If you want to configure it manually then you can select the layer when ever in the layers editor. For example if you 

Limitations:

Due to issues with the latest BouncyCastle and .NET this doesn't support SSL certificates which have ECC public keys, it only supports
RSA. You should be able to manually add filters to specific sites to return an alternative certificate if you have one which is valid 
(say another wildcard cert). This sometimes just means it doesn't work, sometime it gives you a spurious client certificate request. 
Seems to be a bug with all concerned...
